This program is designed to generate 3*3*3 standard Rubiks Cube scrambles, which are
in accordance with official WCA scrambling rules. It's just the console app, but clearly
it will be able to do it's work perfectly by using coloring the output in the terminal window.

The app is produced and developed on MacOS, releases for different platforms are also planned,
it shouldn't be difficult because of portablilty provided by C programming language features.
